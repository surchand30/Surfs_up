# Surfs_up

## Overview :

The idea behind this analysis is to determine if opening a Surf and Shake shop in Oahu Hawaii is going to be a profitable business throughout the year. The main factor determining the success is the weather conditions in Oahu. Too many rainy days could result in the business shutting down. The data comprises of about 7 years of temperature and precipitation recordings across 9 stations in and around Oahu.

## Results:
The analysis performed on June and December months resulted in the following results :

* The average temperature across June and December for the 7 years considered was comparable and not very different.The average temperature for December was 3 degrees less than the average for June. From a temperature perspective, Oahu seems ideal for tourists to want to surf throughout the year.

* Assuming 70 degrees would be ideal surfing weather, there are approximately 380 days in the month of December from 2010 to 2017 (25% of 1517) where the temperature was less than 69%. These days could experience fewer surfers than days when the temperature was higher than 70 degrees. For the month of June, only 89 days of a total of 1700 days had temperature less than 70 degrees making June the more favorable month for surfing.

* The month of December across the years saw extreme temperatures with minimum being 56 and maximum being 83 (27 degree difference). This could mean a lot of unceratainity in planning out the business. The bridge between min and max for June across years was 21 degrees which is a little more consistent across days.

## Summary:

Though temperature plays a crucial role in determining if the business model would succeed, the most important factor to be considered is the number of rainy days. On rainy days, the business could see upto almost zero customers wanting to surf or to buy ice cream.

* Based on the below results , it appears that setting up the surfstore close to UPPER WAHIAWA 874.3, HI US station will be the most profitable. This station has has no rainy days in December since 2010. Also this station has had no rainy days in June in 2011,2012,2014,2015,2016.
